# LitElement JavaScript starter

This project includes a sample component using LitElement with JavaScript.

This template is generated from the `lit-starter-js` package in [the main Lit
repo](https://github.com/lit/lit). Issues and PRs for this template should be
filed in that repo.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```



Alternatively the `test:prod` and `test:prod:watch` commands will run your tests in Lit's production mode.

## Dev Server

This sample uses modern-web.dev's [@web/dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web/dev-server) for previewing the project without additional build steps. Web Dev Server handles resolving Node-style "bare" import specifiers, which aren't supported in browsers. It also automatically transpiles JavaScript and adds polyfills to support older browsers. See [modern-web.dev's Web Dev Server documentation](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/) for more information.

To run the dev server and open the project in a new browser tab:

```bash
npm run dev
```
